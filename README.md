> Customize your screen with something wise

Raven is a wallpaper app, made with the collection of quotes from the books in The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari series.
Raven is powered by [Retrosheet](https://github.com/theapache64/retrosheet) library. 

## How does it work ?

- You can browse through all the available quotes and categories using the app. 
- You can also customize the wallpaper by simply pressing the `"` button. (top right - categories screen).
 Below given some of the gestures and it's functionality in that screen.
